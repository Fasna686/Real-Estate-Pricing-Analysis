### **Real Estate Pricing Analysis**
**Data Visualization using Tableau**

The **Real Estate Pricing Analysis** project focused on enhancing the House Recommendation System for a real estate company by leveraging insights from an exploratory data analysis of the provided House Pricing dataset. The project aimed to present Senior Management with a comprehensive and visually compelling storyboard that illustrated key trends and actionable insights within Boston's real estate market. The analysis was designed to facilitate informed decision-making, empowering management to refine and optimize the existing recommendation system based on data-driven observations.
